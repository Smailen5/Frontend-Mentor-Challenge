## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS
- React


### What I learned

During this project, I focused on improving my skills in:

- Responsive Design: Ensuring the layout adapts well to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
- Form Validation: Handling form validation using Formik and Yup for better user feedback.
- Component Reusability: Creating reusable React components and integrating them with Tailwind UI components.

Code Snippets I'm Proud Of:

```js
<!-- HTML for the form -->
<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} noValidate>
  <label htmlFor="email" className="sr-only">Email Address</label>
  <div className="relative">
    <Field type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email Address" className="peer relative h-12 w-full rounded-full border border-primary-transparent bg-transparent py-3 pl-6 pr-28 text-neutral outline-none placeholder:text-primary placeholder:opacity-50 invalid:border-secondary focus:invalid:border-2" />
    <button type="submit" className="absolute bottom-0 right-0 flex h-full w-16 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-gradient-secondary text-2xl text-white shadow-md peer-invalid:cursor-not-allowed">
      <img src={iconArrow} alt="icon arrow" />
    </button>
  </div>
</Form>
```

```css
/* Custom Tailwind CSS utility */
.text-primary {
  color: var(--clr-desaturated-red);
}
```


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Deepen my knowledge of TypeScript to improve code quality and reduce bugs.
- Explore advanced React patterns like context and hooks for better state management.
- Enhance form validation by integrating more complex validation rules and user feedback.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Essential for understanding utility-first styling.
- [Formik Documentation](https://formik.org/docs) - Great for managing forms and validation in React.
- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/) - For React component and state management best practices.
