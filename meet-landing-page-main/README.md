## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind


### What I learned

I've learned to use base layers to define repetitive classes and keep the code cleaner.

```css
@layer base {
    .btn-default-1 {
      @apply bg-green text-white rounded-full p-3 px-7 text-xs font-bold;
    }
}
```


### Continued development

I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to position the footer correctly in large desktop screen mode. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to solve it. In the future, I'll work on this to get closer to the required layout.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I used the Tailwind documentation while writing the styles.
