## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind


### What I learned

The most challenging part I had to deal with was grid alignment in the desktop layout. It's one of the first times I've used grid, and it's really fantastic.
```html
<div class="md:row-start-2 md:row-end-4 md:max-w-sm"></div>
```

Unfortunately, I couldn't import the fonts as I wanted using `@import` in the CSS file, so I opted to import them in the `index.html` file using the `<style>` tag.
```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@200;400;600&display=swap");
```


### Useful resources

- [Documentazione Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width) - The resource I used the most was the Tailwind documentation.
