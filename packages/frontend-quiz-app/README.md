## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind
- Tailwind Merge
- TypeScript
- Svgr
- React
- React router dom 6

### What I learned

- **Atomic Design**: I became familiar with Atomic Design, organizing the code into hierarchical components (atoms, molecules, organisms), improving code readability and reusability.

- **Practice with TypeScript**: I deepened my understanding of TypeScript, learning to manage types and interfaces, which made my code more robust and less prone to errors.

- **Use of SVGR**: I learned to use SVGR to handle `SVG` icons as React components, simplifying icon management and improving the performance of my application.

- **Dark Mode with Tailwind**: I implemented dark mode using Tailwind CSS, retrieving the preference from the device and saving it in `localStorage` to ensure a consistent user experience.

### Continued development

I want to try adding localization in Italian for the quizzes.

### Useful resources

- [progress bar react](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/progress) - This resource was very helpful for understanding how to set up my ProgressBar. I didn't use this progress bar because when I use Tailwind, I prefer not to write CSS in the global stylesheet.
- [svgr npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-svgr) - Very useful for using SVG icons as React components.
- [svgr resource 1](https://medium.com/@praizjosh/how-to-import-svg-files-as-react-components-in-vite-97d6e1f2c046)
- [svgr resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77280652/vite-plugin-svgr-does-not-working-in-vite-react-and-TypeScript)
