## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library
- [Shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - "Component" library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS superset
- [React+Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - JS library


### What I learned

This exercise has been very useful for learning how to customize Shadcn UI components and practicing with TypeScript.


### Continued development

I notice that I have some issues with the UI when using `absolute` for very large components. In the future, I would like to focus on this and understand what I'm doing wrong.


### Useful resources

- [Shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Documentation.
