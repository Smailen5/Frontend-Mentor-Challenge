## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind
- Shadcn
- TypeScript

### What I learned

This exercise has been very useful for learning how to customize Shadcn UI components and practicing with TypeScript.

### Continued development

I notice that I have some issues with the UI when using `absolute` for very large components. In the future, I would like to focus on this and understand what I'm doing wrong.

### Useful resources

- [Shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Documentation.
